# Double Clicker

Used mostly on games that require high clicks per second such as Minecraft. This script is designed in a way that does not flag anti-cheats (however, some anticheats may be flagged simply because of the high click speed this program gives the player). The program works by sending a click down when the mouse button is released, effectively doubling your clicks while making the timing of your clicks completely natural (to not alarm anti-cheats). 

Must have Autohotkey installed.
